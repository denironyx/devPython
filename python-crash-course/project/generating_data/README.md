## Generating Data
Data visualization involves exploring data
through visual representations. It’s closely
associated with data analysis, which uses code
to explore the patterns and connections in a data
set. A data set can be made up of a small list of numbers
that fits in one line of code or it can be many gigabytes
of data.

Making beautiful data representations is about more than pretty pictures.
When a representation of a data set is simple and visually appealing,
its meaning becomes clear to viewers. People will see patterns and significance
in your data sets that they never knew existed.
Fortunately, you don’t need a supercomputer to visualize complex data.
With Python’s efficiency, you can quickly explore data sets made of millions
of individual data points on just a laptop. Also, the data points don’t have to
be numbers. With the basics you learned in the first part of this book, you
can analyze nonnumerical data as well.

#### Installing Matplotlib

To use Matplotlib for your initial set of visualizations, you’ll need to install
it using pip, a module that downloads and installs Python packages. Enter
the following command at a terminal prompt:

#### Plotting a Simple Line Graph
Let's plot a simple line graph using Matplotlib, and then customize it to create a more informative data visualization.
